# Writing SOLID Code & Keeping it DRY
This is a simple presentation about SOLID and some other best practices in Software Engineering. You can either download it as an archive from [here](http://harindaka.github.io/solid/) and open the "Presentation.html" to run it locally or run it online from my blog [here](http://www.harindaka.com/2015/02/writing-solid-code-keeping-it-dry.html). Please note that you will need an internet connection in both situations as the presentation is hosted online.
